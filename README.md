# Fractions-V1
Project reads in a series of fractions from a text file, which will have each line formatted as follows: “A/B”.  The purpose of the program is to read in each fraction and count the number of occurrences for the current fraction.  When all the input is consumed (or as the input is consumed), the program will print out its list of unique fraction and their corresponding count.
